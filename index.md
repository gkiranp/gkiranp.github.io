I have more than 12 years of industry experience in `Embedded Software Design` and `Development`, using modern `C++11/14` programming. I have worked on Firmware, Middleware and Application levels in Embedded Systems, also worked on hardware level debugging and troubleshooting using Oscilloscopes and logical-Analyzers.
I am proficient in Linux based `System Programming`, with very good experience in `designing and debugging` `multi-Process` and `multi-Threaded` solutions with proper `synchronizations`. My specialty is to `design flexible solutions` which can be easily fit into frequently changing requirements. In design experience in extensively using suitable `Algorithms, Data-Structures, STL-Containers, Scripts and Design Patterns`.
I standout with hands-on experience in working on `Safety Critical standards`, such as `IEC61508` (functional safety for Electrical/Electronic components) and `EN50128` (safety standard for Railways), following MISRA and Adaptive-AUTOSAR software development guidelines. I have used `VxWorks-Cert` RTOS for developing Safety Critical products.
Apart from Embedded Systems and System programming, I have taken personnel interest in UI/UX design using `Qt` framework. I am equally experienced in building cross-platform software which can compile in multiple environments like Linux, Windows, Mac and Android.
I have worked on `Android AOSP` (Native) development for Intel platforms, which involves AOSP porting and building custom applications(for API level 25, Android 7) using Native C++ from Qt-Android framework.
I am well experienced in full software product development life cycle, with hands on experience in Agile development. In Agile, I have played the role of both Senior Developer and Scrum Master. I also have good `project management` experience, like producing SOW, HLD, Functional Design, Architecture design, code review, testing, requirement traceability and root-cause analysis. I have participated in Design-FMEA process and suggested some safety requirement changes. I have insightfull experience in `documenting` activities using `UML2.0` at all the levels of software development process.
