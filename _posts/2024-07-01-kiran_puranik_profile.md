**UST Global Sdn Bhd, Penang, Malaysia - Sr. Technical Analyst**  
*APRIL 2019 - OCTOBER 2021 [ Senior Technical Analyst ]  
*APRIL 2017 - MARCH 2019   [ Technical Analyst ]  
Role: Lead/Senior Developer | Responsible for coordinating with the team and making sure technical projects are completed and delivered in time. Also responsible for the design and developing C++ based embedded system safety-critical software in the Trainborne project. 
Developed EN50128 safety  standard module ‘System Mode and Redundancy’ using C++, which handles different system modes of transitions, like normal, degraded, fail-safe modes, during runtime. Module also interacts with different components, like Health Monitor, Radio Comm etc, in-order to find health status and communication status, depending on which the module decides the operating mode. The module has a decision-making factor, which is programmed for a redundant system to take over if the running system breaks.
Developed communication parser modules using C++, like Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) parser, which interacts with external CAD system using Motorola DIMETRA radio network, for voice and data communication and also two communication protocol wrappers, TRCP Protocol Handler, TCI Protocol Handlers, which in underneath uses Motorola standard SBEP serial protocol to communicate with external interfaces like TETRA modem, TRCP hardware and for  communication between two TCI devices.
Developed Health Monitor module, using C++ and observer design pattern, which monitors voltage, current and temperature levels and provides subscribe and receive health status of the system for different module-level interaction.
Designed and developed a module Test Framework using Python and pySerial library interface, to perform command based testing of different components in TCI, later, the same framework is utilized for Test Automation in CI/CD purpose.
